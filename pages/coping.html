        <h1>Personality disorders</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>The most effective type of therapy appears to be dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). This type of therapy focuses on the concept of mindfulness, or being aware of and attentive to the current situation</li>
          <li>Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP) - This form of therapy is rooted in the patient’s confused and contradictory sense of identity associated with emotionally intense mental images of themselves and others. The therapist helps the patient unconsciously reassign extreme positive or negative images associated with one person to another person, such as the therapist. In that moment, the therapist talks with the patient to interpret and understand why the patient distorts his or her sense of self and images of other people. Therapy addresses intense shifts in emotions as patients learn to reflect and verbalize what they’re feeling, rather than acting out these emotions impulsively.</li>
          <li>Schema-Focused Therapy (SFT) - This type of therapy focuses on reframing “schemas,” or the ways people view themselves. This approach is based on the idea that BPD stems from a dysfunctional self-image – possibly brought on by negative childhood experiences – that affects how people react to their environment, interact with others, and cope with problems or stress.</li>

          <li>Psychotherapy</li>
          <li>Medication</li>
          <li>Beyond Treatment</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Talk with your doctor about treatment options</li>
            <li>Engage in mild physical activity or exercise to help reduce stress</li>
            <li>Set realistic goals for yourself</li>
            <li>Break up large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can</li>
            <li>Try to spend time with other people, and confide in a trusted friend or relative. Tell others about things that may trigger symptoms.</li>
            <li>Expect your symptoms to improve gradually, not immediately</li>
            <li>Identify and seek out comforting situations, places, and people</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The main treatments for PTSD are talk therapy, medicines, or both. PTSD affects people differently, so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. If you have PTSD, you need to work with a mental health professional to find the best treatment for your symptoms.</li>
          <li>Talk therapy, or psychotherapy, which can teach you about your symptoms. You will learn how to identify what triggers them and how to manage them. There are different types of talk therapy for PTSD.</li>
          <li>Medicines can help with the symptoms of PTSD. Antidepressants may help control symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling numb inside. Other medicines can help with sleep problems and nightmares.</li>

        <h1>Psychotic disorders</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) uses an electric current to treat serious mental disorders. This type of therapy is usually considered only if a patient's illness has not improved after other treatments (such as antidepressant medication or psychotherapy) are tried, or in cases where rapid response is needed (as in the case of suicide risk and catatonia, for example).</li>
          <li>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) works through a device implanted under the skin that sends electrical pulses through the left vagus nerve, half of a prominent pair of nerves that run from the brainstem through the neck and down to each side of the chest and abdomen. The vagus nerves carry messages from the brain to the body's major organs (e.g. heart, lungs and intestines) and to areas of the brain that control mood, sleep, and other functions.</li>
          <li>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) uses a magnet to activate the brain. First developed in 1985, rTMS has been studied as a treatment for depression, psychosis, anxiety, and other disorders. Unlike ECT, in which electrical stimulation is more generalized, rTMS can be targeted to a specific site in the brain. Scientists believe that focusing on a specific site in the brain reduces the chance for the types of side effects associated with ECT. But opinions vary as to what site is best.</li>
